# This is a list of working concepts for problems that may or may not be implemented.

- Web: Wikipedia Edit History (similar to last year's, but make it different and perhaps more difficult, such as by encrypting with caesar at the same time and/or embedding in user/talk space instead of article.)

- Crypto: Google Auth OTP. Problem gives an TOTP seed and tells participant that "this is the one code that makes all the codes." Then ask participant to submit a TOTP token valid at the time of submission (+/- 1 minute).

- Web: Embed flag in Bitcoin blockchain as OP_RETURN in a transaction. Came up with this idea with Miles.

- Crypto: Caesar. Got to have the caesar, or some other type of introductory crypto problem.

- Crypto: Classic one time pad re-use problem. Crack ciphertext for flag!

- Web: Register domain name and keep the domain name secret as a flag. (Example: pactf-this-cannot-be-a-flag-can-it.com) Then submit it to Chromium's HSTS preload list so that it is included in Chrome's public source code. Problem hints at participants that the domain name is hidden in Chromium's source code.

- Web: I believe picoCTF did this at some point. Simply hide a flag somewhere on the PACTF website itself. Or maybe hide it on our status page at pactf.statuspage.io

- Web: Cloudflare business customers can upload custom SSL certificates. Add a certificate in which an additional domain, where the flag is hosted, is present in the Subject Alt. Name field of the certificate.
