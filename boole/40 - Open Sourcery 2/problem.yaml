description: There are many strings in the source code of the latest Google Chrome. Some of the strings contain `pactf`. Find the one that starts with `i`, ends with `e`, and also contains the letter `v`.
hint: Maybe you *could* get the source from the binary. But what's this relationship between Chrome and Chromium I heard? Also, just so you know, this flag doesn't have the string `flag` in or around it.
