   #### PACTF DRM
   The flag is in [encrypted.txt]({% ctflexstatic "encrypted.txt" %}).
   You also get the [decoder software]({% ctflexstatic "a.out"%}). Unfortunately,
   the software is protected by its own custom DRM(Digital Rights Management).
   ...And it's very protective about its things.

  You'll need to somehow make it change its mind?
