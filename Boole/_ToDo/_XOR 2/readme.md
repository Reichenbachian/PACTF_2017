This is an XOR cipher. To figure out the key, use the fact that in English, if you shift a message by n letters, you expect around 8% of letters to be the same. Thus if the key has length 5, if you shift by 2 then you'll get less than 8% agreement since the shifted alphabet is different, and you'll get 8% when you shift by 5. From there, you can do frequency analysis/some guess and check to figure out each letter of the key, and finally the whole message.
