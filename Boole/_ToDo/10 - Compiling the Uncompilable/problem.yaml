    RoboCorp is quite serious about security. No one person knew all of the flag â€” until now, when a brave agent inside the frontlines rushed to a terminal and managed to type `git merge` and send you the resulting file without being detected.

    Unfortunately, when Git picked their merge markers to "not compile in any known language", they hadn't considered [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).

    Your task, if you choose to accept it, is to figure out what the individual halves of the flag were before the poor strings were merged.
