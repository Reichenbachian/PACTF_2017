**This is meant to be the first problem of PACTF 2017.**

The solution to this problem is to find the pull request in the PACTF repository in which I mention the flag quite... explicitly.

I submitted a pull request which includes a .md file which includes the flag for this problem. It is in the /crypto/ directory.

The PR can be found [here](https://github.com/PACTF/pactf/commit/9345ac104a8453914ee4d1fcb72546ab7162d50a)
