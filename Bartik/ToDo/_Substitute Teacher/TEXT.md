**This is the "decrypted" text which will *not* be distributed to competitors. Instead, its "encrypted" version (available in ENCRYPTED.md) will be distributed.**

In cryptography, a substitution cipher is a method of encoding by which units of plaintext are replaced with ciphertext, according to a fixed system; the "units" may be single letters (the most common), pairs of letters, triplets of letters, mixtures of the above, and so forth. The receiver deciphers the text by performing the inverse substitution. (Wikipedia.org, "Substitution cypher")

This is, for your sake, a completely normal English text. We were so nice, we decided to leave capitalization in the encrypted text... & punctuation! Aren't we nice. There is a relatively normal letter distribution in this text, so it shouldn't have been too difficult to solve. Anyway, congratulations! Here is your flag: only_slightly_better_than_caesar
