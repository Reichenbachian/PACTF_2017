This problem gives the seed of a OTP in QR form as its problem text. To add a bit of difficulty, the flag is the OTP time at 9:00 PM, March 17th. As a result, participants will have to implement their own OTP system to find the correct authenticator password.

To add further complexity, the time is given in UNIX epoch form (`1489798809000`).

hours:minutes:seconds:am/pm
