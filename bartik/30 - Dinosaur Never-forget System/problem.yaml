   #### Those Dinosaurs...

   The dinosaurs need some way to archive their messages and news for the future, so they created the Dinosaur Never-forget System.
   They wanted the login to be public, but they also didnâ€™t want it to be too easy to find.
   So they hid it in a system more antiquated than the dinosaurs themselves.
