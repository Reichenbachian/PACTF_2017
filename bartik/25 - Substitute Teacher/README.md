**This is a simple substitution cipher problem, solvable via frequency analysis.**

The key used is **ISOGRAMYXWOFDNQ**, generating the following substitution map:

from  `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`
to    `ISOGRAMYXWFDNQBCEHJKLPTUVZ`

When the text included in **TEXT.md** is fed through the cipher, it generates what is included in **static/ENCRYPTED.txt**.

The participants must solve this problem through relatively simple frequency analysis.

The flag is **only_slightly_better_than_caesar**.
