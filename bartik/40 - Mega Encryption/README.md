I left a message on Tony's Wikipedia talk page. In it, I included an obviously fake message on behalf of "Personal Advancement of Cuil Therory Foundation (PACTF)." You can see my edit [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tony_Tan&diff=770856430&oldid=754349065). I used my own personal MegaEncryption algorithm (recursive base64) to encrypt the message.

To solve the problem, participants must recursively decode the base64 until they hit the original message, which is (somewhat politically):

`Oh my goodness! It's gotten so bad. The cuils are rising... they want to outlaw encryption... I'd rate their world +200 Cuils! At least I have MegaEncryption (TM) to keep me safe. the_cuil_is_too_much_to_handle`

The flag is `the_cuil_is_too_much_to_handle`.
