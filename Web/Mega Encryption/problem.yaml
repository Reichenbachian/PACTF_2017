   The Personal Advancement of Cuil Therory Foundation (PACTF) left a message for [Tony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tony_Tan), but they used MegaEncryption (TM) to encrypt it. What did they say? Should we be worried? It seems like they used some sort of public medium to send the message...

  They kept records!
